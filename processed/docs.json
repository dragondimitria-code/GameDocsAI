    "text": "How to test Bonuses\nThere are a huge number of bonuses for players in the game. In fact, the game is all about receiving bonuses from\ndifferent entities of the game. Every type of bonus and penalty can be either permanent or temporary and work both\nways. Bonus affects a specific entity (e.g. a specific unit) or a whole group (e.g., bonus to defending fighters, bonus\nto trap production speed). Almost all bonuses for certain essences are summed, and only then applied to the base\nvalue. Almost nowhere is there such a thing as a bonus being applied to a value already under the effect of another\nbonus. Conventionally, bonuses can be divided into several large groups:\nBonuses of timing decrease \nResources production bonuses\nResources collection bonus\nCost reduction bonuses\nBonuses that reduce the chance of getting something\nBattle bonuses\nIt's easy to use Balance Editor values to check the bonus changes. \nBonuses of timing decrease \nThe final time duration is calculated as follows:\nТ = Т(original) * 100 / (100 +sum),\nТ is new time duration;  \nТ(original) is the original process timings from Balance Editor; \nSum is the sum of all bonuses to this speed.\nNote: \"march acceleration\" item is called acceleration, but in fact just cuts off a percentage of time. Example: the\nmarch goes to the place of 1 minute, when you apply expendable item \"march speed +50%\" march will just go 30s\ninstead of a minute, if you apply it again, then 15s, etc.\nResources production bonuses\nP = P(original)* (100+ sum)/100\nP(original) is an original number of resources that produces per hour. The number from Balance Editor; \nSum is the sum of all bonuses to this resource production. \nResources collection bonus\nThere are two options:\n1. percentage increase to the resource received, e.g, 10% more resources from the outpost;\n2. numerical increase, e,.g., +1 free key to open chests.\nThe percentage increase is calculated as follows:\n",

The number from Balance Editor;\nSum is um of all bonuses to this chance. \nIt's easy to check the chance using 0, 50, and 100%. You can get something with 100% chance when the bonus is\nactive. At 50%, you need to do several iterations to judge whether the chance is realistic or not.\nBattle bonuses\nBattle bonuses are calculated as a direct percentage of the sum of all bonuses to the original value. \n shows how the resulting parameter value is used to calculate battle characteristics.\nBattle bonuses are also written into the log on each battle.\nGame formulas\npage\nHow to test pvp-system.\n",
